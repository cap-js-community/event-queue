## v1.4.2 - 2024-04-XX

### Added

- [cds-outboxed] Add eventQueue processor, key, queueEntries, and payload to req (can be accessed via req.context.\_eventQueue)
- Add option `insertEventsBeforeCommit` to improve performance for `publishEvent`.
- Add cds shutdown handler to clear existing redis locks before shutdown of the instance.

### Fixed

- [cds-outboxed] Call cds.connect.to for open outboxed events

### Changed

- Removed authInfo from context.http.req and moved to a full-fledged xssec/xsuaa authInfo attached to context.user.authInfo

## v1.4.0 - 2024-03-21

### Added

- add to supply custom redis options for create client.

### Changed

- Reworked periodic processing of all events to be more efficient and to reduce the load on the database and use less database connections.
- Removed support for custom tables. The event-queue now uses always the provided tables.

## v1.3.6 - 2024-03-14

### Fixed

- Redis reconnects

## v1.3.5 - 2024-03-12

### Fixed

- In instances of overlapping intervals, periodic events may fall behind schedule.

## v1.3.4 - 2024-03-08

### Added

- Trigger processing again if time is exceeded for event processing.

### Changed

- removed CF check to enable redis to allow using redis even if process.env.USER is not vcap.

## v1.3.3 - 2024-03-06

### Changed

- Default for runInterval changed from 5 minutes to 25 minutes. This is to reduce the load on the database.
- The load of the internal periodic event DELETE_EVENTS is increased to 20 to only process 5 tenants in parallel. This is to reduce the load on the database.
- The max processing time for the event-queue is set to the runInterval.

## v1.3.2 - 2024-03-01

### Added

- option for delayed events for cds outboxed services: [documentation](https://cap-js-community.github.io/event-queue/use-as-cap-outbox/#how-to-delay-outboxed-service-calls)

### Fixed

- Delay registration of processors until the database connection is established.

## v1.3.1 - 2024-02-21

### Fixed

- Log message for blocked events

### Changed

- Reduce log severity for skip publish redis event as no lock is available to debug
- Only do etag checks after a processing time of 10 minutes to improve performance

## v1.3.0 - 2024-02-21

### Added

- add option to block ad-hoc events. More information in [documentation](https://cap-js-community.github.io/event-queue/configure-event/##blocking-events).
- Define priorities for event types. More information in [documentation](https://cap-js-community.github.io/event-queue/configure-event/#priority-of-events).

### Fixed

- In more cases the global cds.context was not set correctly because the async-chain could break in high load scenarios.

### Fixed

- In some cases the global cds.context was not set correctly because the async-chain could break in high load scenarios.

## v1.2.5 - 2024-02-13

### Added

  start. This option is intended for development purposes.

### Fixed

- Allow to initialize event-queue without config.yml in case of usage as CAP outbox

### Changed

### Added

- block the run of periodic events via
  config [documentation](https://cap-js-community.github.io/event-queue/configure-event/#blocking-periodic-events)
- Add a label to the workerQueue. This will help in understanding which events were throttled in case of throttling.
- The `isEventQueueActive` configuration can now be used to deactivate the runtime processing of all events.
- with the function `getLastSuccessfulRunTimestamp` the timestamp of the last successful run for a periodic event can be
  requested. [documentation](https://cap-js-community.github.io/event-queue/implement-event/#using-the-timestamp-of-the-last-successful-run-for-the-next-run)
- Added a performance tracer for periodic events. This will log any processing that takes longer than 50ms.
- Added type and subtype to all performance traces.

### Fixed

- Catch exception during Redis channel subscription
- Endless running if event status open is returned and checkForNextChunk is activated

### Changed

- Refactored the deletion process for completed events. The default setting for deleting processed events has now been

- the configuration variable `isRunnerDeactivated` is renamed to `isEventQueueActive`.
- Reduced the log severity to debug for "Selected event queue entries for processing" during periodic events.
