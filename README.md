The Event-Queue is a framework built on top of CAP Node.js, specifically designed to enable efficient and streamlined
asynchronous event processing in a multi-tenancy environment. With a strong emphasis on load balancing, this package
ensures optimal distribution of workload across all available application instances. By offering managed tenant-specific
transactions, similar to CAP handlers, the Event-Queue framework simplifies event and asynchronous processing, thereby
enhancing the overall performance of your application.

## Getting started

- Run `npm add @cap-community/event-queue` in `@sap/cds` project
- Activate the cds-plugin in the cds section of the package.sjon

### As cds-plugin

Extend the cds section of your package.json. Reference to the cds-plugin section in the capire documentation about the
cds-plugin concept.
https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/releases/march23#new-cds-plugin-technique

```json
{
  "cds": {
    "eventQueue": {
      "plugin": true,
      "configFilePath": "./srv/eventQueueConfig.yml"
    }
  }
}
```

## Features

- load balancing of event processing throughout app instances
- control concurrency in app instances
- managed transactions for event processing
- async processing of processing intensive tasks for better UI responsiveness
- push/pull mechanism for reducing delay between publish an event and processing
- cluster published events during processing (e.g. for combining multiple E-Mail events to one E-Mail)
- plug and play via cds-plugin
