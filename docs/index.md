# cds-event-queue

The Event-Queue is a framework built on top of CAP Node.js, designed specifically for efficient and
streamlined asynchronous event processing. With a focus on load balancing, this package ensures optimal
event distribution across all available application instances. By providing managed transactions similar to CAP
handlers,
the Event-Queue framework simplifies event processing, enhancing the overall performance of your application.

## Install or Upgrade

```bash
npm install --save @cap-js-community/event-queue
```
