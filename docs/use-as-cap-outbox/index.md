The event-queue can be used to replace the CAP outbox solution to achieve a unified and streamlined architecture for
asynchronous processing. If this feature is activated, the event-queue replaces the outbox implementation of CAP with
its own implementation during the bootstrap process. This allows leveraging the features of the event-queue, such as
transaction modes, load balancing, and others, with outboxed CDS services.

## How to enable the event-queue as outbox mechanism for CAP

The initialization parameter `useAsCAPOutbox` enables the event-queue to act as a CAP outbox. To set this parameter,
refer to the [setup](/event-queue/setup/#initialization-parameters) part of the documentation. This is the only
configuration needed to enable the event-queue as a CAP outbox.

```json
{
  "cds": {
    "eventQueue": {
      "useAsCAPOutbox": true
    }
  }
}
```

## How to Configure an Outboxed Service

Services can be outboxed without any additional configuration. In this scenario, the service is outboxed using the
default parameters of the CAP outbox and the event-queue. Currently, the CAP outbox implementation supports the
following parameters, which are mapped to the corresponding configuration parameters of the event-queue:

| CAP outbox  | event-queue             | CAP default       |
| ----------- | ----------------------- | ----------------- |
| chunkSize   | selectMaxChunkSize      | 100               |
| maxAttempts | retryAttempts           | 20                |
| parallel    | parallelEventProcessing | yes (mapped to 5) |
| -           | useEventQueueUser       | false             |

The `parallel` parameter is treated specially. The CAP outbox supports `true` or `false` as values for this parameter.
Since the event-queue allows specifying concurrency with a number, `parallel=true` is mapped
to `parallelEventProcessing=5`, and `parallel=false` is mapped to `parallelEventProcessing=1`. For full flexibility, the
configuration prioritizes the `parallelEventProcessing` parameter over `parallel`.

The `useEventQueueUser` parameter can be set to true or false. When set to true, the user defined in the [general
configuration](/event-queue/setup/#initialization-parameters) will be used as the cds context user (context.user.id).
This influences actions such as updating managed
database fields like modifiedBy. The default value for this parameter is false.

All supported parameters available for [EventQueueProcessors](/event-queue/configure-event/#parameters) are also
available for CAP outboxed services. This means
that you can use the same configuration settings and options that you would use with EventQueueProcessors when
configuring CAP outboxed services, ensuring consistent behavior and flexibility across both use cases.

Parameters are managed via the `cds.require` section, not through the config yml file as with other events. For details
on maintaining the `cds.requires` section, refer to
the [CAP documentation](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/node.js/core-services#required-services). Below is an example of
using the event-queue to outbox the `@cap-js/audit-logging` service:

```json
{
  "cds": {
    "requires": {
      "audit-log": {
        "outbox": {
          "kind": "persistent-outbox",
          "transactionMode": "alwaysRollback",
          "maxAttempts": 5,
          "checkForNextChunk": true,
          "parallelEventProcessing": 5
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The parameters in the outbox section of a service are passed as configuration to the event-queue.
The `persistent-outbox` kind allows the event-queue to persist events instead of executing them in memory, mirroring the
behavior of the [CAP outbox](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/node.js/outbox). The parameters `transactionMode`,
`checkForNextChunk`, and `parallelEventProcessing` are
exclusive to the event-queue.

## Example of a Custom Outboxed Service

### Internal Service with `cds.Service`

The implementation below demonstrates a basic `cds.Service` that can be outboxed. If you want to configure outboxing
via `cds.env.requires`, the service needs to inherit from `cds.Service`.

```js
class TaskService extends cds.Service {
  async init() {
    await super.init();
    this.on("process", async function (req) {
      // add your code here
    });
  }
}
```

Outboxing can be enabled via configuration using `cds.env.requires`, for example, through `package.json`.

```json
{
  "cds": {
    "requires": {
      "task-service": {
        "impl": "./srv/PATH_SERVICE/taskService.js",
        "outbox": {
          "kind": "persistent-outbox",
          "transactionMode": "alwaysRollback",
          "maxAttempts": 5,
          "checkForNextChunk": true,
          "parallelEventProcessing": 5
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Application Service with `cds.ApplicationService`

In contrast, `cds.ApplicationService`, which is served based on protocols like odata-v4, cannot be outboxed via
configuration (`cds.env.requires`). Nevertheless, outboxing can be performed manually as shown in the example below:

```js
const service = await cds.connect.to("task-service");
const outboxedService = cds.outboxed(service, {
  kind: "persitent-outbox",
  transactionMode: "alwaysRollback",
  checkForNextChunk: true,
});
await outboxedService.send("process", {
  ID: 1,
  comment: "done",
});
```

### How to Delay Outboxed Service Calls

The event queue has a feature that enables the publication of delayed events. This feature is also applicable to CAP
outboxed services.

To implement this feature, include the `x-eventqueue-startAfter` header attribute during the send or emit process.

```js
const outboxedService = await cds.connect.to("task-service");
await outboxedService.send(
  "process",
  {
    ID: 1,
    comment: "done",
  },
  // delay the processing 4 minutes
  { "x-eventqueue-startAfter": new Date(Date.now() + 4 * 60 * 1000).toISOString() }
);
```

### Additional parameters Outboxed Service Calls

Similar to delaying published events, it is also possible to provide other parameters when publishing events. All event
publication properties can be found [here](/event-queue/publish-event/#function-parameters).

### Error Handling in a Custom Outboxed Service

If the custom service is invoked via `service.send()`, errors can be raised with `req.reject()` and `req.error()`.
The `reject` and `error` functions cannot be used if the service call is made via `service.emit()`. Refer to the example
below for an implementation reference.

```js
class TaskService extends cds.Service {
  async init() {
    await super.init();
    this.on("rejectEvent", (req) => {
      req.reject(404, "error occured");
    });

    this.on("errorEvent", (req) => {
      req.error(404, "error occured");
    });
  }
}
```

Errors raised in a custom outboxed service are thrown and will be logged from the event queue. The event entry will be
marked as an error and will be retried based on the event configuration.

### Event-Queue properties

The event queue properties that are available for the native event queue processor (refer
to [this documentation](/event-queue/implement-event/#minimal-implementation-for-ad-hoc-events)) are
also accessible for outboxed services utilizing the event queue. These properties can be accessed via the cds context.
The following properties are available:

- processor: instance of event-queue processor
- key
- queueEntries
- payload

```js
class TaskService extends cds.Service {
  async init() {
    await super.init();
    this.on("send", (req) => {
      const { processor, queueEntries, payload, key } = req.context._eventQueue;
    });
  }
}
```

### How to return a custom status?

It's possible to return a custom status for an event. The allowed status values are explained [here](/event-queue/status-handling/).

```js
this.on("returnPlainStatus", (req) => {
  return EventProcessingStatus.Done;
});
```
