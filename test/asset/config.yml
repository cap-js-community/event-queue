# NOTE:   retryAttempts:               for infinite retries maintain -1 as 'config.retryAttempts'
#                                      default retry attempts is 3
#         runOnEventQueueTickHandler   if true the events will automatically process on the eventQueue tick handler
#                                      load the load passed to the funnel - value needs to be between 1 - 100
#                                      this property is only allowed if runOnEventQueueTickHandler is true
#         parallelEventProcessing      how many events of the same type and subType are parallel processed after clustering
#                                      default value is 1 and limit is 10
#         eventOutdatedCheck           checks if the db record for the event has been modified since the selection and right
#                                      before the processing of the event. default is true
#
#         commitOnEventLevel           after process event the associated transaction is committed and the associated status
#                                      is committed with the same transaction. This should be used if events should be
#                                      processed atomically. default is false
#         selectMaxChunkSize           Number of events which are selected at once. Default is 100. If it should be checked
#                                      if there are more open events available set the parameter checkForNextChunk to true
#         checkForNextChunk            Determines if after processing a chunk (the size depends on the value of selectMaxChunkSize)
#                                      a next chunk is being processed if there are more open events and the processing
#                                      time has not already exceeded 5 minutes. Default is false
